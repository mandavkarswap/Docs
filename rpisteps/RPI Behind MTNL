RPI Behind MTNL or static IP


1. Problem Dynamic IP, solved by DDNS service provider No-IP Currently on free plan.
2. RPI getting Diffrent IP by router because of DHCP
	Solved by fixing local IP in RPI address what happens when someone is, allready alloted that IP

If one is changing tomorrow
	Possible port forwarding not working, map differet port rather than default one, contact mtnl write to trai get static IP
